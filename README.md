Black Box Variational Inference in Julia

## Workflow
- The `main` branch should accept only working code.
- The `dev` branch should contain all developmental work.
    - If tests pass, they can be added to `main`, at which point, the package version in `Project.tomal` and git tag 
      should be updated accordingly (using semver).
    - Commits in dev should be squashed before pushing to `main`.
